### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington where I have gained knowledge in the domains of Database Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Software Engineering, and Distributed System.

The interest in coding has increased day by day after exploring and contributing to the open-source projects on Github. I am very influenced by the Linus Torvalds founder of Linux. How open-source projects could change the world, as almost all the servers used Linux as it's the kernel.

My areas of interest are cloud computing, software engineering, database management, front-end development, and backend development.

I have been working on one start-up as a full-stack developer. It's an educational website. We are using ReactJs, NodeJs/ExpressJs, MongoDB, and AWS as libraries and could services and using GitLab as code management and GitLab-board as ticket management.

I have a real-world software industry experience. In which, I have developed API in Spring Boot and maintain the relational database. It was great exposure to work under the multi-culture environment.
